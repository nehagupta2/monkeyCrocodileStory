Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a Monkey who resides on a jamoon tree,
which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest, there lived a Crocodile and his wife.
One day, the Crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. 
The Kindheareted Monkey offered him some fruits. The Crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them
AS the days passed by, the Crocodile and the Monkey became best friends.
